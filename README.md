# Arduino-TB6600-NEMA23-PIR-rnd
Senzor will detect movement and then will make random turns (from 1-9) in a random direction using the step motor NEMA23 via the TB6600 driver.

Project is made with:
- Arduino UNO
- TB6600 driver 
- NEMA 23 step motor
- MEAN WELL 24V 75W power supply
- PIR movement sensor
